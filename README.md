## 🧠 Philosophy & Methodology

My approach to cybersecurity is built on:
1.  **Probabilistic Thinking:** Applying Bayes' theorem and logic to triage alerts and reduce false positives.
2.  **The Art of Investigation:** Moving beyond tools to understand the *intent* and *narrative* of an attack.
3.  **Documentation:** Believing that if it isn't documented, it didn't happen.

## 🖥️ Current Lab Infrastructure

My projects are built and tested in a dedicated home lab environment:
* **Hardware:** Dell AIO Server
* **Virtualization:** VMware ESXi
* **Visualization:** JupyterLabs (integrated with GitHub for reporting)
